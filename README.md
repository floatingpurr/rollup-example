# rollup.js example

Just a `rollup.js` experiment, based on a customization of the [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app)

## Usage

Installing dependencies from [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json):

```bash
$ npm install
```

Development environment (_TODO: browser livereload_):

```bash
$ npm start
```

Building the production bundle ([dist](dist)):

```bash
$ npm run build
```

# Further Notes

* Bundle files (JS) are not intentionally checked in the code base.
* Use [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) to exploit a Docker environment with VSCode remote, otherwise simply ignore it.
